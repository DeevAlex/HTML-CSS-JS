                        <p class="enemy-letra">I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
                            For my mind to run around with my ear up to the ground
                            I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
                            When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned
                            Tell you you're the greatest
                            But once you turn they hate us
                            Oh, the misery
                            Everybody wants to be my enemy
                            Spare the sympathy
                            Everybody wants to be my enemy
                            (Look out for yourself)
                            My enemy (look, look, look, look)
                            (Look out for yourself)
                            But I'm ready
                            Your words up on the wall as you're praying for my fall
                            And the laughter in the halls and the names that I've been called
                            I stack it in my mind and I'm waiting for the time
                            When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic
                            Tell you you're the greatest
                            But once you turn they hate us (huh)
                            Oh, the misery
                            Everybody wants to be my enemy
                            Spare the sympathy
                            Everybody wants to be
                            My enemy (look, look, look, look)
                            (Look out for yourself)
                            My enemy (look, look, look, look)
                            (Look out for yourself)
                            Uh, look
                            Okay, I'm hoping that somebody pray for me
                            I'm praying that somebody hope for me
                            I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be
                            P-P-Posted, being a wreck of emotions
                            Ready to go whenever, just let me know
                            The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
                            The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable
                            I'ma tell 'em hasta luego
                            They wanna plot on my trot to the top
                            I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut
                            I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
                            And it matters more because I had it not
                            Had I thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition
                            Kinda shocking they wanted static with precision, I'm automatic
                            Quarterback, I ain't talkin' sacking
                            Pack it, pack it up, I don't panic
                            Batter, batter up, who the baddest?
                            It don't matter 'cause we at ya throat
                            Everybody wants to be my enemy
                            Spare the sympathy
                            Everybody wants to be
                            My enemy
                            Oh, the misery
                            Everybody wants to be my enemy
                            Spare the sympathy
                            Everybody wants to be my enemy
                            Pray it away, I swear
                            I'll never be a saint, no way
                            My enemy
                            Pray it away, I swear

                            Then you wink at me and walk away
